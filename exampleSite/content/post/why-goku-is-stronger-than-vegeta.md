#### It may sound simple, but I'll just give you a brief overview. Goku is definitely more effective than Vegeta. Goku is stronger when he is willing to train or learn with other students. Throughout Dragon Ball's series Goku has many mentors including master son roshi. Almost all of what he used as an instructor in the field of martial arts is based on his students'aggressive approach to martial arts.


## Goku is always powerful because he has trained obsessively

There's no one in the world who can beat Goku. He's always powerful because he has trained obsessively. Goku started training as a child and disciplined himself so that he became the strongest being in the universe. He has never given up, no matter what.

What started as a simple contest between two friends has turned into one of the most famous, and iconic, anime series of all time. Goku is a powerful fighter because he has trained obsessively for years, something that no other person can match. His power comes from his unmatched durability and strength, which are both honed through years of hard work.

Vegeta is known as the lazy and unathletic Saiyan who doesn't have the same Venerable training as Goku. He was born in a royal family and never participated in any sports or physical activity like Goku. It was only when he was age 10 that he heard about the Saiyans and decided to join them in their fight against Frieza. 
After joining the army, Vegeta developed some skills in hand-to-hand combat and finally became a good fighter. despite his lack of athletic ability, he has been able to beat many opponents with his powerful attacks and strategic planning.

When Goku was young he never knew how to use his power. It was something that he just had. He would always be working hard in practice, trying to get better and stronger. One day, after years of hard work, Goku finally got his chance to use his power in a real battle and came out victorious.

  

## Vegeta's ultra Ego

Vegeta's ultra ego is one of the many reasons why he is one of the strongest characters in the Dragon Ball series. Vegeta's extreme anger and dislike of others has caused him to become a formidable opponent, even against powerful opponents like Goku. His hatred for any form of weakness and his unwillingness to submit to anyone or anything leads him to be one of the most powerful characters in the series.
