[Why Is “My Hero Academia” So Popular?](https://amzn.to/3fBtjaD)
================================================================

**[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T9CdcpzoSGE/YGcnnvKMx4I/AAAAAAAABT0/CHwZxJ4Einka307RKKuPdR41D9m407Y4gCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://amzn.to/3fBtjaD)**

An entertaining series featuring great characters with a creative and whacky multiplicity of superpowers. The plot is generally light-hearted and a bit more substantial than some shonen manga-anime-- while there is a plethora of action, it does not just feel like a series of pleas for the characters to fight each other.

Horikoshi-s art is stunning, and for the nuts of the show seeing so multitudinous iconic scenes ripped directly from the panels is a stunning treat. All 15 volumes came in great quality with no issues.  

A must-read - from the art to the storytelling!!! This is one of the best comics of all time!!!! Order it now - trust me you will not regret it!

[My Hero Academia, Vol. 1](https://amzn.to/2OgtEUZ)
===================================================

  

  

Midoriya inherits the superpower of the whole god of the universe. What would the planet like if 80% of the population showed superpowers known as "curiosities?" Gods and villagers are going to fight it all together! To be a God means to learn to use your power, but where are you going to study? Naturally, the Hero Academy! What would you do, though, if you were one of the 20% that Quirkless was born?

Izuku Midoriya, a middle academic pupil, wishes to be an added god, but he doesn't have an ounce of strength in himself. His life looks to be loaded and more like a daughter without ever attending the prestigious U.A. high school for blooming gods.

[My Hero Academia, Vol. 2](https://amzn.to/3fxNSot)
===================================================

A great graphic novel! Not much felt like from the beginning, but the fight with his bully bursting was cool, and the cliffhanger would definitely keep you involved. Witty humor (mainly) and the fantastic art and capacity for you to really do your work. Read this if you like superheroic stories.

[My Hero Academia, Vol. 3](https://amzn.to/3wk44zB)
===================================================

This is the volume of concern for people who have watched the anime, so we hit the point where the anime ended and realize the plot continues. I was very excited to see how things will grow, how class 1-A members are progressing. A lot of competition has happened to my surprise, but it makes me smile at the same time because this gives me the chance to know them better and to get them deeper.

[My Hero Academia, Vol. 4](https://amzn.to/3uhppI5)
===================================================

It was an entertaining volume! The sports festival rages - and you don't care about your ordinary sports festival. Both teamwork and human competencies are checked. I now have a new favorite character - a little bit problematic - near Todoroki's Midoriya! He is strong, but we know little about him or her life at the same time. Mysterious! - Mysterious! Moreover, he seems determined to win Midoriya, which provides Midoriya with an incredible chance to develop strategies/ways to win on his own – for he still cannot manage his own strength.

[My Hero Academia, Vol. 5](https://amzn.to/3sND3SR)
===================================================

  

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-olLbPYOLQmA/YGcrf-4QRqI/AAAAAAAABUk/F-SaeBeV_tsxS6Csd3bJw5lWxEtO-cVFwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://amzn.to/3sND3SR)

  

That's my preferred volume of the series so far. In the previous volume, any stress and anger have finally come to light. The climax is perfect, not too long and not too quick, just perfect! More about Todoroki and her history, like an extra benefit for me, can also be learned. All in all, this finishing volume gave me a sour feeling, but I certainly wanted more!

Midoriya isn't familiar with his latest Quirk at the beginning of the episode (and right in the middle). Too frail is his body, which causes him to crack his bones to protect himself or unleash a strong attack.

  

While Midoriya does not give up, he hurts himself each time he throws a punch.

Some fans may be bored of Midoriya being repeatedly wounded in the broadcast, but I think it adds an inspiring aspect to which anime and superheroic films are lacking.
